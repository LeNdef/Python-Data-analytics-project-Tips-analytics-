Originally, this data was collected for teaching and research purposes in statistics and behavioral economics. It was later included in the Seaborn Python library as one of its example datasets, used widely by students and data scientists to learn data visualization, correlation analysis, and machine learning basics.

We try to answer the folling questions:
- What factors affect how much people tip ?
- Do social or situational factors influence tipping ?
- How group size or toial bil amount impacts the percentage of the tip

The project was part of the first project for the M2M tech Python bootcamp.
